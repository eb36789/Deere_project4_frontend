# Site summary
This site is a one stop shop to store the Freeman family's favorite meals, and randomly generate meal ideas so mom and dad don't have to decide all the time.  Our goal is to eliminate the daily debate of "what's for dinner" by leveraging technology to help us generate the answer.  Additional benefits include being able to display a visual of the meal plan to the entire family AND save time and money grocery shopping by having a plan in place before we hit the store!
